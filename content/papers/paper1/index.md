##### Abstract

[WORK IN PROGRESS] There is an increasing need to hold players responsible for negative or positive impacts that take place elsewhere in a network or directed graph. We evaluate an upstream value that allocates the total impact of the network among the players, taking into account their direct impact and their indirect impact through the underlying graph. Moreover, we show that the responsibility value satisfies a set of natural yet important properties that resemble a well-known solution concept in cooperative game theory, the Shapley value.
